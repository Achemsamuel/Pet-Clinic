# Pet-Clinic
A dynamic form for a Pet Adoption App using JSON values. No form builder used.

This app uses the Codables protocol to decode the JSON file and read through it to populate the elements in the view.
Although Codables can be quite complex for large data, it's so far one of the best ways of decoding json and biding the results to model objects.
